# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio where I show all my current projects so people could get to know my work better.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
Use the `--base-href` and `--deploy-url` flags to define the context of the project.
